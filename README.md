ROS driver for the Pololu M3PI robot

Development status
------------------

Components have been tested with real robot hardware, although not extensively.

As I no longer have any use for a M3Pi ROS driver, I do not plan to develop this driver further or port it to Catkin. If you are interested in doing so, feel free.
